INT. BLACK SCREEN ‚Äì NIGHT

                         THE COLONIZED VOICE (V.O.)
           I am the song you tried to silence.

MONTAGE ‚Äì ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE

British ships docking. Traditional masks boxed. Maps cut with rulers.  
Blood staining old parchment. A colonial officer stamping a red wax seal:  
‚ÄúBRITISH PROTECTORATE.‚Äù A native child‚Äôs hands forced to trace a border line.

                         TEXT OVERLAY
           ‚ÄúHistory is written by victors. Memory is kept by survivors.‚Äù

FADE IN:

EXT. WEST AFRICAN LANDSCAPE ‚Äì DAY

Cracked soil. Harmattan wind. Children run past a defaced colonial statue.  
One boy stops. Looks up. The statue‚Äôs bronze eyes are gouged out.

                         NARRATOR (V.O.)
           This is not a film. This is a reckoning.

INT. SCHOOL CLASSROOM ‚Äì 2003 ‚Äì DAY

A crumbling classroom. A weary TEACHER points at a dusty colonial map.

                         TEACHER
           This is Nigeria. Say it with me.

                         CHILDREN (in unison)
           Ni-ge-ria.

YOUNG AKIN (10) blinks. He stares at the lines like they don't belong there.

INT. RADIO STATION ‚Äì PRESENT ‚Äì NIGHT

Adult AKIN (late 20s), dreadlocks tucked under a cap. He adjusts a mic.  
Streetwear stitched with a faded, blood-stained agbada.

                         AKIN
           Pirate Radio 99.9. Welcome to history unchained.
           Tonight: The Name Game. Nigeria. What does it mean?  
           Who named it? Who profited?

He presses play. Static fades into...

FLASHBACK ‚Äì INT. LUGARD‚ÄôS OFFICE ‚Äì 1900s

FREDERICK LUGARD writes ‚ÄúThe Dual Mandate.‚Äù Tea cup. Slave registry open.

                         LUGARD (V.O.)
           The natives are docile. Trainable. But fragmented.  
           We shall call it... Nigeria. From the Niger.

FLORA SHAW watches from a velvet chair, pleased.

                         FLORA
           A name. For our journal. For your dominion.

She inks: ‚ÄúNIGERIA‚Äù in cursive ‚Äî like signing a curse.

INT. UNIVERSITY ARCHIVE ‚Äì NIGHT

ZAINAB, veiled, Hausa. She scrolls through hacked colonial files.

One map reads: **TRIBE INVENTION LOG ‚Äì 1911**

                         ZAINAB (V.O.)
           They left us their system. I‚Äôm rewriting the code.

She downloads: **LANGUAGE-SUPREMACY-POLICIES.zip**

EXT. CHIEF EMEKA‚ÄôS COMPOUND ‚Äì EVENING

Cicadas. Palm trees. AKIN sits across from CHIEF EMEKA (70s), stoic.

                         CHIEF EMEKA
           I translated their freedom into our chains.  
           I was their interpreter. Words are weapons, boy.

                         AKIN
           You helped them?

                         CHIEF EMEKA
           I was seventeen. I thought I was speaking independence.  
           But every word signed away something sacred.

He hands Akin a colonial badge. It glints. Shame, engraved.

SYMBOLIC SEQUENCE ‚Äì QR MASKS

A tribal mask morphs into a QR code. It scans.

Data reveals: **"Sub-Saharan Classification - Type B: Easily Governed"**

                         THE COLONIZED VOICE (V.O.)
           They didn‚Äôt draw lines. They drew scars.

FLASHBACK ‚Äì MONTAGE ‚Äì BERLIN CONFERENCE ‚Äì 1884

Animated map. White gloves. Slicing Africa like cake. Clock ticks.  
Scissors snip.

           Our rivers, split. Our names, stitched. Our gods, renamed.

INT. BRITISH MISSION SCHOOL ‚Äì 1940s ‚Äì DAY

A BLACK BOY is whipped for stuttering the English alphabet.

The chalkboard behind him reads: **‚ÄúCIVILIZATION.‚Äù**  
Above: A cross. Below: His blood.

INT. DIGITAL LAB ‚Äì NAIROBI ‚Äì NIGHT

KAMAU overlays old maps on new. Perfect match. Fractures align.

                         KAMAU
           We didn‚Äôt inherit nations. We inherited algorithms.

He presses ENTER. Ethnic conflict zones light up.  
Corporate logos flicker: Shell. BP. Glencore.

INT. ZAINAB‚ÄôS ROOM ‚Äì NIGHT

Her screen flashes: Tribe Inventories. Church Grants. School Rankings.

                         ZAINAB
           Every census, every curriculum ‚Äî a colonial spell.

INT. PIRATE RADIO STATION ‚Äì MIDNIGHT

AKIN reads into mic.

                         AKIN
           1914. Amalgamation. Not unity ‚Äî merger.  
           Not freedom ‚Äî framework.

Distorted archival audio plays. Lugard‚Äôs voice:  
"Indirect rule. Native authority..."

EXT. SLUM BROADCAST TOWER ‚Äì NIGHT

An antenna made of scrap and defiance.  
Kids huddle by radios. Elders cry quietly.

Young girls raise fists.

                         THE COLONIZED VOICE (V.O.)
           They named us. Numbered us. Now we speak back.

DREAM SEQUENCE ‚Äì INT. MUSEUM OF TIME

ESI THE TIMEKEEPER walks through a void.  
Floating relics whisper in African tongues.

She stops by a border map.

                         ESI
           This map is a wound. Still bleeding.

INT. CHIEF EMEKA‚ÄôS COMPOUND ‚Äì DAWN

Emeka burns his colonial badge in a calabash.

                         CHIEF EMEKA
           Let this be my reparation.

INT. RADIO STATION ‚Äì SUNRISE ‚Äì FINAL BROADCAST

AKIN hits record. Eyes fierce.

                         AKIN
           This isn‚Äôt nostalgia. This is an autopsy.  
           Nigeria. Who signed it? Who bled for it?

He plays a distorted anthem. Screaming drums overlay.

EXT. PAN-AFRICAN MONTAGE

Youth paint over maps. Digital art glitches borders.  
QR tattoos scan censored truths.

                         THE COLONIZED VOICE (V.O.)
           Memory is the revolution they fear the most.

INT. BRITISH MISSION SCHOOL ‚Äì 1940s ‚Äì DAY

CAMERA: Tight handheld. Every breath, every flinch, every bruise ‚Äì intimate.

A TEACHER (British, pinched face, white-knuckled hand) lifts a cane.  
A terrified BLACK BOY, 8, stammers, trembling.

                         TEACHER
           Say it again. A. B. C.

                         CHILD (sobbing)
           A... B... C...

A rosary dangles from the teacher‚Äôs wrist ‚Äî swaying like a noose.  
Behind them: a chalkboard scrawled ‚ÄúENGLISH = SALVATION.‚Äù

INT. MISSION SERVER ROOM ‚Äì PRESENT ‚Äì NIGHT

CAMERA: Cold, fluorescent. Low-angle tech horror.

ZAINAB (hoodie, defiance in her knuckles) types like she‚Äôs striking drums.  
The screen glitches, then stabilizes:  
**FILE FOUND: LANGUAGE SUPREMACY POLICY ‚Äì FINAL REPORT**

                         ZAINAB
           Weaponized education. Holy lies.  
           God and Empire in the same textbook.

She unzips the file. Buried truths uncoil like vipers.

EXT. KENYA HIGHLANDS ‚Äì TWILIGHT

CAMERA: Cinematic wide. Wind over sacred ground.

NDUTA (elder griot, face carved by colonial wounds) sits on a rock.

                         NDUTA
           When they burned our shrines, they claimed we were saved.  
           But their god came with prisons.

etched like ancestral code.

MAGS (20s, idealistic) sits upright. Class in session.  
A British AGENT holds up a Bible.

                         AGENT TRAINER
           The Bible is a gateway.  
           You hold it in one hand. The camera in the other.  
           Both gather intelligence.

Symbolism: The cross morphs into crosshairs.  
Slide projected: ‚ÄúOPERATION: CONVERT + CATALOGUE‚Äù

CAMERA: MAGS watches footage ‚Äî a native ritual labeled ‚ÄúTHREAT.‚Äù

---

INT. UNIVERSITY HALL ‚Äì PRESENT ‚Äì DAY

ZAINAB storms into a colonial literature class.  
The PROFESSOR freezes mid-lecture.

                         ZAINAB
           What you call education ‚Äî was indoctrination.  
           What you call enlightenment ‚Äî was erasure.

She slams a laptop open. Projection floods the wall:  
**TOP 10 REDACTED POLICIES ‚Äì AFRICA**

Students murmur. One begins to film.  
The Professor swallows dust older than his credentials.

INT. CYBERCAF√â ‚Äì NIGHT

ZAINAB, hunched in shadows. Screen glow lights her jawline.

                         ZAINAB (V.O.)
           No language is neutral.  
           No silence is safe.

NDUTA lights a single candle under a cracked crucifix.  
She places a tribal sculpture beside it.

                         NDUTA (V.O.)
           They tried to baptize memory.  
           But memory does not drown.

CAMERA: Dolly back. The sculpture casts a shadow of a traditional god.  
Syncretism as resistance.

INT. RADIO STATION ‚Äì NIGHT

AKIN tunes the board. His voice low. Measured.

                         AKIN
           They taught us alphabets with rulers.  
           Their silence was strategy.  
           Our memory is revenge.

He hits PLAY.

ARCHIVAL AUDIO: Overlapping chants, rulers striking desks, distorted hymns.

                         AKIN (CONT‚ÄôD)

                         ELECTION OFFICER
           We are missing entire registers!

                         VOTER
           You said we‚Äôre not in the system? We built the damn roads to this place!

**Soldiers patrol**, hands twitching near triggers.

FLASHBACK ‚Äì KANO ‚Äì 1953 ‚Äì BRITISH CENSUS TENT ‚Äì DAY

A BRITISH OFFICER smirks, ruler in hand. Native clerks hesitate.

                         BRITISH OFFICER
           Double-count the North.  
           Call it... population advantage.

He scribbles onto a ledger:

INT. CHIEF EMEKA‚ÄôS COMPOUND ‚Äì NIGHT

CAMERA: Overhead. Kola nut tray becomes map. Chalk diagrams spiral like tribal circuitry.

                         CHIEF EMEKA
           They called it zoning. Said it was fairness.

                         AKIN
           But it was still divide and rule ‚Äî just with a native accent.

                         CHIEF EMEKA
           Power dressed as equity. Still slavery in syllables.

He taps a kola nut onto a region.

                         CHIEF EMEKA (CONT'D)
           They gave us boundaries... then told us not to cross them.

           This wasn‚Äôt democracy.  
           It was colonial data wrapped in tribal clothing.

Map zooms into Nigerian Delta: **Shell logos** glowing beneath state boundaries.

                         KAMAU (CONT'D)

           We inherited blueprints of bondage.

EMEKA smiles, eyes glistening.
