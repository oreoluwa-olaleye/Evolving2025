  <h1>The Black Man is Not a Fool</h1>
  <p>He is Wise.</p>
</header>

<main class="container">

  <p>Let’s get this straight: the Black man isn’t stupid. <br>
  He isn’t lazy. <br>
  He isn’t lost.</p>

  <p>He’s just been;<br>
  misread, misquoted, and misunderstood by a world too loud to listen and too proud to learn.</p>

  <p>Before the castles of Europe, there were the cities of Kush, the libraries of Timbuktu, the bronze heads of Ife.<br>
  While others were chasing shadows, the Black man was building soul.</p>

  <p>He didn’t sail the seas to claim other lands because he was too busy cultivating his own.<br>
  He didn’t colonize the world because he had nothing to prove.</p>

  <strong>He was whole.</strong>

  <p>You think he was a fool because he didn’t conquer?<br>
  No. He was wise because he didn’t need to.</p>

  <blockquote>Wisdom isn’t always loud. Sometimes it’s rooted, still, and patient.</blockquote>

  <p>Africa birthed the world, then watched as her children forgot her name.<br>
  The ones who left returned centuries later, dressed in armor and arrogance, calling themselves discoverers.</p>

  <blockquote>Funny. How do you discover where your umbilical cord was buried?</blockquote>

  <p>These so-called colonizers? Just prodigal siblings who couldn’t endure the test of time.<br>
  They traded soul for steel, harmony for hegemony, spirit for spectacle.</p>

  <p>The African didn’t forget. He remembered rhythm, remembered rain, remembered roots.<br>
  He didn’t carve up the earth. He danced on it. Lived with it. Knew its names.</p>

  <p>While others built empires to feel big, Africa built legacies to stay eternal.<br>
  Kingdoms didn’t rise through greed, but through grace.<br>
  Power wasn’t about how many you could kill, but how many you could feed.</p>

  <p>Even in war, the Black man fought with rules.<br>
  Even in pain, he knew balance.<br>
  His strength wasn’t in how hard he hit, but in how deeply he endured.</p>

  <strong>And let’s be real: the world didn’t leave Africa behind. It ran from her.</strong>

  <blockquote>Because truth this deep makes the shallow shake.<br>
  Because spirit this rich makes the greedy nervous.</blockquote>

  <p>Colonization wasn’t a flex. It was a failure; a sign of lost identity.<br>
  You don’t need to steal what you can grow. Unless you’ve forgotten how to plant.</p>

  <p>Africa remembered.<br>
  Even when dragged in chains, even when renamed and reshaped, she remembered.<br>
  That’s why we still drum. Still sing. Still rise.</p>

  <p>They took gold, but couldn’t steal glory.<br>
  They took names, but not knowing.<br>
  They took people, but not purpose.</p>

  <strong>And still, here we are. Speaking. Building. Reclaiming.</strong>

  <p>We are not what they painted.<br>
  We are the canvas, the color, and the story.</p>

  <p>We didn’t colonize because we didn’t need to.<br>
  Our greatness wasn’t in how far we could reach, but in how deep we were rooted.</p>

  <p>We had gods before missionaries.<br>
  We had trade before borders.<br>
  We had systems before colonial order.</p>

  <blockquote>Europe didn’t invent civilization. It stumbled upon memory.<br>
  A memory we carried in blood and bone.</blockquote>

  <p>The Bantu moved with balance. The Yoruba ruled with structure. The Ethiopians wrote with ink before most of Europe could spell its own name.</p>

  <p>…but they don’t teach you that in school.<br>
  They show you chains, not crowns. Ships, not scripts.</p>

  <strong>They fear what we remember.</strong>

  <p>Because once we remember who we are, the illusion breaks.<br>
  And when the illusion breaks, so does their version of power.</p>

  <strong>The Black man is not a fool.</strong>

  <p>He is fire, filtered through patience.<br>
  He is thunder, holding back out of love.<br>
  He is not waiting for a seat at any table. He is the tree the table was carved from.</p>

  <p>Our story isn’t tragedy. It’s transformation.<br>
  It’s not what they did to us, it’s what we do next.</p>

  <blockquote>Because the comeback is always greater than the setback.</blockquote>

  <p>And this time, we’re not asking for respect. We’re building it.</p>

  <strong>So write it clearly: the Black man is not a fool.</strong>

  <p>He is the first. The root. The rhythm. And he’s not done.</p>
