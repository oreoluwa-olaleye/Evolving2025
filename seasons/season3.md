# 🍬 Season 3: **Sugar, Shackles & Silence**  
*The Caribbean’s Sweetest Crop Was Its Cruelest Curse.*

> “They did not steal gold. They stole generations — bound in sweetness and buried in silence.”  
> — *The Colonized Voice*

---

## 📍 Focus: Jamaica, Barbados, and the West Indies  
The Caribbean wasn’t just colonized — it was industrialized.  
From lush islands to blood-soaked plantations, the sugar trade became the crown jewel of British wealth — and the graveyard of millions of African souls.

## 🔎 Core Themes

- **Human Commodification**: Africans were priced per tooth, whipped for fatigue, and bred like livestock.  
- **The Silence Doctrine**: Rebellions were erased from records. Dialects were criminalized. Drums were banned.  
- **Black Women’s Rebellion**: From Nanny of the Maroons to silent poisonings — resistance was tactical, maternal, spiritual.  
- **Economic Foundations**: The British economy — including universities, banks, and royals — profited directly from sugar slavery.  

> 🎭 *Every teaspoon of sugar was measured in bone.*
