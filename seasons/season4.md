# 🧱 Season 4: **Apartheid by Blueprint**  
*The Architecture of Racism Was Drafted in an English Office.*

> “The fences came later. First, they mapped your skin.”  
> — *The Colonized Voice*

---

## 📍 Focus: South Africa

Before apartheid was law, it was language.  
Before it was a fence, it was a file.  
Before it was "separate development," it was British colonial urban planning and race categorization — disguised as civil order.

This season explores how the British Empire didn't just colonize land — it **designed** oppression, systemized racial separation, and **exported it** as policy to the future architects of apartheid.

## 🔎 Core Themes

- **British Colonial DNA in Apartheid**:  
  Pass laws, native reserves, urban segregation — all piloted by British administrators before 1948.

- **Color as Control**:  
  Bureaucratic obsession with race categories: "White", "Coloured", "Native", "Asian".  
  Families torn apart by the *Pencil Test*.

- **Mission Schools as Mind Control**:  
  "Civilizing" African children by erasing their tongues, tribes, and timelines.

- **Economic Exclusion Zones**:  
  Mining compounds, township restrictions, and native labor exploitation for British profits.
