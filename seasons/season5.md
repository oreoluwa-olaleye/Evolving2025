# 🕊️ Season 5: **The Palestine Partition**  
*Ink on paper. Blood in sand.*

> “They gave away what wasn’t theirs.  
They drew a border with no regard for breath.”  
— *The Colonized Voice*

## 📍 Focus: Palestine

In 1917, the British Empire issued a promise that would ignite a century of war:  
**The Balfour Declaration** — a letter that claimed authority over a land it neither owned nor understood.

This season reveals how colonial penmanship fractured the Middle East and sowed a geopolitical nightmare still smoldering today.

## 🔎 Core Themes

- ✍🏽 **The Balfour Declaration**  
  The British government’s imperial arrogance — promising a Jewish homeland in a region populated by Arabs, Christians, and Jews alike.

- 🧱 **Divide and Displace**  
  British "administration" pitted communities against one another, laying the groundwork for land seizures, ethnic cleansing, and apartheid-style tactics.

- 🗝️ **Nakba Before Nakba**  
  The catastrophe began *before* 1948 — through British policing, curfews, and the dehumanization of Arab identity.

- 📜 **From Protector to Provoker**  
  The so-called “British Mandate” became a military occupation.
