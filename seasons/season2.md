# 🇮🇳🇵🇰 Season 2: *The Raj Illusion*
**India & Pakistan — The Crown's Grandest Lie.**

> “They promised unity but planted division.  
They called it governance, but ruled with hunger.”  
— *The Colonized Voice*

---

## 🎞️ Overview

**The Raj Illusion** uncovers the colonial theatre staged in South Asia — a web of control disguised as civilization, and violence wrapped in velvet.

From **British East India Company schemes**, to **Queen Victoria’s imperial theatrics**, from **railroads of resource extraction**, to the **1947 Partition** that cleaved the subcontinent in blood — this season tells the story of **how illusion became law.**

## 🔥 Key Themes

- **The Fiction of the "Civilizing Mission"**  
  → How education, railways, and bureaucracy masked cultural erasure.

- **Divide & Rule Doctrine**  
  → Muslims vs Hindus, Sikhs vs everyone — engineered divisions that still burn today.

- **Gandhi’s Peace vs Empire’s Brutality**  
  → The paradox of nonviolence met with systemic rage.

- **The Great Loot**  
  → India’s GDP was 25% of the world before colonization — by 1947, just 4%.

- **Partition: The Red Map**  
  → One stroke of ink displaced 15 million people and killed over a million.
