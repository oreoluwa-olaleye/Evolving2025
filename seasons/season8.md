# 🌊 Season 8: **Oceania’s Chains**  
*The empire called it “discovery.” We remember it as disappearance.*

> “They said the land was empty. So they emptied it.”  
> — *The Colonized Voice*

---

## 🪃 Focus: Australia & New Zealand

In Oceania, the Crown did not **negotiate**. It **declared**.  
Season 8 excavates the **genocidal policies**, **racial experiments**, and **ongoing cultural erasure** faced by:

- **Aboriginal Australians**
- **Torres Strait Islanders**
- **Māori communities**

---

## 🔥 Major Arcs

- **Terra Nullius: The Colonial Lie**  
  The legal doctrine that justified mass land seizure. *“Empty land” justified full violence.*

- **Stolen Generations**  
  Thousands of Indigenous children forcibly removed from families to “civilize” them.

- **Dreamtime Disrupted**  
  Sacred stories mocked, censored, erased. Language lost. Spirits displaced.

- **Māori Rebellion**  
  From passive protest to armed resistance — how haka became a war cry again.
