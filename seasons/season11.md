*Gold that glittered. Freedom that flickered.*

> “They called it the Gold Coast. But it was blood that gleamed the most.”  
> — *The Colonized Voice*

## 🗺️ Focus: Ghana  
This season dives deep into **Ghana’s colonial blueprint**, tracing its rise from slave coast to the first African nation to gain independence — only to be haunted by betrayal, neo-colonial debts, and resource extraction déjà vu.

But **Season 11** does more.

It introduces a **dual-frame**:  
**Ghana vs. Nigeria** — *Gold Coast vs. Black Gold.*
