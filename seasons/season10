## 🕊️ The Empire Strikes First

How did they kill revolution?

- **Surveillance & Sabotage**  
  Funded coups. Infiltrated movements.

- **Western Media Warfare**  
  Painted rebels as “terrorists.” Heroes became headlines of fear.

- **Erasure by Curriculum**  
  Schools that mention Gandhi omit Bhagat. Mandela, not Biko. Kings, not Queens.

> *“Colonialism didn't end. It rebranded. But rebels remember.”*
