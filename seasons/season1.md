# 👑 Season 1: **The Curse of the Crown**
*Nigeria & Kenya — Two Nations, One Spell of Betrayal.*

> “They drew borders with rulers and ruled with borders.”  
> — *The Colonized Voice*

## 🔥 SEASON OVERVIEW

Season One of **EVOLVING: Beyond the British Spell** sets the tone — brutal, unfiltered, and revelatory.

We travel to **Nigeria** and **Kenya**, two former British colonies whose independence came wrapped in chains of division, economic sabotage, and spiritual distortion.

- 🗺️ *Nigeria*: Where indirect rule fractured tribes into fragile states — birthing the zoning curse, Biafra, and Boko Haram’s shadows.
- 🌋 *Kenya*: Where the Mau Mau uprising was met with brutal concentration camps, mass sterilizations, and media blackouts.

This is the **genesis of post-colonial trauma** — the Crown’s original sin on African soil.
