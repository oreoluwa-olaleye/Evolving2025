# 🏯 Season 7: **The Crown in Asia**  
*Trade was the bait. Empire was the hook.*

> “They came to ‘open ports.’  
But what they opened… was a wound.”  
— *The Colonized Voice*

---

## 🌏 Focus: Malaysia, Burma (Myanmar), and Hong Kong

Asia was not conquered with cavalry, but with **contracts**, **companies**, and **cannons hidden behind trade treaties**. Season 7 exposes the **three-pronged strategy** of the British Empire in East and Southeast Asia:

- 🏴 **Commerce disguised as diplomacy**  
- 🧠 **Education as indoctrination**  
- 💣 **Rebellion met with ruthless suppression**

---

## 🔍 Key Themes

- **Opium & Occupation**  
  How addiction financed an empire. China bled silver. Hong Kong was the trophy.

- **Divide by Design**  
  Ethnic engineering in Burma and Malaya — how Empire exploited difference.

- **Port Cities Turned Prisons**  
  Penang. Rangoon. Victoria Harbour. The price of being “strategically located.”

- **Silencing Native Sovereignty**  
  Cultural erasure, royalty dethroned, and law weaponized against identity.
