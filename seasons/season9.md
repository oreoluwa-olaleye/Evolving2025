# 📚 Season 9: **The Education Lie**  
*They taught us English. Then erased us with it.*

> “They opened our minds — just wide enough to fit their chains.”  
> — *The Colonized Voice*

---

## 🏫 Focus: Global Mission Schools  
From West Africa to India, the Caribbean to Southeast Asia — colonial "education" was not a gift. It was a **weapon**.

Season 9 reveals how the British Empire used **schools**, **curriculums**, and **religion** to:

- Strip native children of their language and identity  
- Rewire loyalty toward the empire  
- Train subservient bureaucrats, not free thinkers

> Classrooms became conversion camps.  
> Language became a leash.

## 🔍 Major Arcs

- **Boarding School Trauma**  
  Native children ripped from families, placed in Christian mission schools.

- **Linguistic Colonization**  
  Banning of indigenous languages. Punishments for native speech. English as superiority.

- **Curriculum of Erasure**  
  African kingdoms? Omitted. Indian science? Ignored. British “civilization”? Glorified.

- **Diploma Dependency**  
  How paper certificates created a cycle of internalized inferiority.

## 🧠 Did You Know?

- In Nigeria, students were **beaten** for speaking Yoruba or Igbo in schools until the 1990s.  
- The British classified **English-speaking Africans** as “civilized,” others as “native.”  
- The **Macaulay Minute on Indian Education (1835)** literally called for Indians “in blood, but English in taste.”
